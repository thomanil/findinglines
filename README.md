# findinglines

I'm teaching myself to draw in pencil and
pixels. [findinglines.net](http://findinglines.net) is a simple
blog/journal where I post some of the stuff I produce along the way.

I don't want to fid-dle around with the web interface at DeviantArt or
some Wordpress blog each time I post something. And I want it to be
maintenance free. Therefore it's set up as a static site generated out
of Emacs org-files and images I upload to Dropbox as I go along.
